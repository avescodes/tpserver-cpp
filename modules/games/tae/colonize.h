/*  Colonize class
 *  
 *  This class defines the colonize FleetOrder used by colonist fleets.
 *  The colonize order targets an uninhabited/uncolonized system which
 *  is valid for the fleet giving the order.  It creates a new colony,
 *  awards one point of the same type as the fleet to the owner of the
 *  leader in the region of the new colony.  It may also initiate an 
 *  external combat if connecting two regions with leaders of the same
 *  type.
