Monday:
*Investigated SVG, its going to work, *shoots some fireworks
**Using circles as planets isn't the best though, rectangles will work better as the are different tags (than connections, which are paths), but who knows *shrugs*. Labels can be set properly using inkscape, and connections have "start" and "end"s that include these labels

Tuesday:
*Got TinyXML working
*Rudimentary import created -> must use inkscape, draw rects for planets, set id to name and label to name.

Wednesday:
*Got name imports working, moving on to screencasts tomorrow, give mentors/admins time to digest

Thursday:
Screencasting scripts, mainly looking at getting my wife to dub

Friday:
Getting my courses worked out: will be taking discrete math, prog. practices, scientific comp, intro to AI, and Languages
Looking into counting constellations -> actually harder than I thoguht
