Monday:
Player messaging in Colonize, first try baby!

=========================================================================================


This Week:
* I’d like too spend a day or two next week buffing up my knowledge on C++. In particular I’d like to read Effective C++, as well as some other web resources I’ve been pointed to.
 * Focus will mainly be on testing, playtesting, and code refinement.

Later:
XML/YAML/graphviz map import
Look for AI to test with
Contribute to documents for ruleset creation
Create set of shell/example classes for ruleset dev
Add ability to repeatedly attack

XML Map importing:
tags - <MAP> has <CONSTELLATION>s have <SYSTEM>s have (<NAME><ID?><LOCATION><NEIGHBOUR>)
Create all constellations... (store pointer to each constellation created)
Create all Planets (w/o entering in neighbours)
	Store planet <ID>or<NAME> tag in a map to the planet's ACTUAL in-game ID.
Add all adjacencies
