Early Week:
Read all of Effective C++
Read some XML documentation, particularly on DTD's and schema
Started looking into parsers for XML/C++
Finished up "alpha" testing

Friday:
Tested 2 games with Jackie
Found numerous bugs, fixed many (show commits.) Particularly cleaned up errors with Attack logic (extra unit creation, "cheating" by increasing odds)
Some bugs are more difficult than others, particularly VIEW problems, and phantom ownerships.
Player (wife) noted that getting started document should be more clear, as a non-gamer many things aren't as intuitive as I felt they were. Map connectivity not displayed is an issue.
