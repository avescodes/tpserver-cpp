Welcome to the Risk ruleset map creation screencast. My name is Ryan Neufeld, or jaffer for short, and I will be walking you through using Inkscape to create your own maps for the Risk ruleset. 

Let us cut directly to the chase.
*Switch to open inkscape window with existing default map.
Maps in risk are made up of a few simple things; Take for example the default map for risk...
*Draw attention to the various rectangles representing planets.
Rectangles represent planets, 
*Twiddle mouse over filled color of rectangle
the color of the rectangle represents continent, 
*Open object properties to show the names
the labels of the rectangle represent the names of the planets, 
*Draw attention to diagram connectors and the button to make new ones
Diagram connectors indicate connectivity between planets, and finally, 
*Bring attention to constellation labels
colored text assigns a name and bonus to the continent whose color it is written in (reword this). 

Now that you've seen the pieces that make up a Risk map we can move on to creating our own
*Transition to blank map
Any old blank SVG document will do, but for parsing reasons the document needs to be created using Inkscape (at the moment). Lets get started

To create a new planet all you need to do is select the rectangle creation tool, 
*Show ways to get to the tool.
and pick a fill color from the color bar.
*Show how to select a color
It is important to note, identical colors across rectangles represent constellations/continents. If you chose to fill some rectangles with say, pure white, and eggshell white, each color would represent a different constellation. Even if YOU cannot differentiate between similar colors, the parser can.

When creating the default map I found it easiest to create all my planets first, and arrange them, before connecting them with connectors.
*Create a few rectangles, arrange them like the big dipper.
Once you're satisfied with the layout of your planets its time to give them names. 
*Again show the procedure for opening the Object Properties dialog.
Right click on a given rectangle and click Object Properties (a shortcut for this is selecting the object and pressing Ctrl-Shift-O). In this properties dialog replace the id and label with the desired name for the planet. Don't forget to fill both boxes or connectors won't work. Click set when you are finished
*Click the set button.
This process should be repeated for each planet. For brevity I will omit completing the procedure on the remaining planets.

Once you've named your planets its time to give a name to the constellations. To do this we create a text box. 
*Show process of selecting text tool.
Select the text tool and click on any open space to create a new title. Type the name of your constellation,
*Type Big Dipper
 followed by a vertical bar (which can be found above the enter key on the keyboard),
*Type |
 followed by an integer representing the bonus reinforcements provided for owning the whole constellation. 
*Type 3
It should look just like this.
*bring attention to whole label
 Once you've given a name and a bonus select the text in the textbox by clicking and dragging the mouse
*Select all the availible text in the box
 across it and select the same color on the color bar as the color of the rectangles the label applies too.
*Select color of big dipper

The only step left now is to connect the planets. To do this we select the "Diagram connector" tool in the tools bar. This procedure must be done carefully as an incorrect connector will LOOK like it connects two rectangles when in actuality it does not. Hover your mouse over the center of the first rectangle until a small square appears, but your mouse into that square and click and drag towards the target rectangle. While still holding the mouse down hover over the target rectangle until a similar box appears. Move the cursor over the said box, and release. If done correctly a connector should appear that touches the edges of both rectangles.

Once you've finished your map its time to load the map into tpserver-cpp. To do so you must specify the absolute path (or relative path, if you know from which folder tpserver-cpp will run)  of the location of the map inside the config file you will be using. Once the path is entered correctly you are ready to start playing.
