Welcome to the Risk ruleset "Playing Risk - basic" screencast. My name is Ryan Neufeld, or jaffer for short, and I will be walking you through playing the Risk ruleset for thousand parsec. This screencast assumes you've viewed the tp client screencast and are comfortable using said client.

*Open up tpclient
This screencast assumes your connecting to an already existing tpserver playing Risk. If you don't have a server to connect to, and would like to run your own, you can run risk on that server using one of the two included quickstart config files. Documentation on installing and running a server is also availible at triple double u, dot, thousandparsec, dot net, under the getting started section.

*connect to risk server.

*go over basic rules of risk
*how risk is played in thousand parsec
*BASIC information about orders, colonize, move, reinforce.
*How to find out your availible units
*misc. little basic things

*Thank user for watching, suggest there are many nuances to playing risk on thousand parsec that can be learned by watching the advanced play screencast.

**All of this should be very low-key and, frankly, basic. The user should be able to issue all 3 order types after watching the screencast, but not understand any of the nuances in mechanics or otherwise.
