Welcome to the Risk ruleset "Playing Risk - basic" screencast. My name is Ryan Neufeld, or jaffer for short, and I will be walking you through playing the Risk ruleset for thousand parsec. This screencast assumes that you've viewed the tp client screencast and are comfortable using said client.

*Open up tpclient
This screencast assumes your connecting to an already existing tpserver playing Risk. If you don't have a server to connect to, and would like to run your own, you can run risk on that server using one of the two included quickstart config files. Documentation on installing and running a server is also availible at triple double u, dot, thousandparsec, dot net, under the getting started section.

Let us connect to our Risk server.
*connect to risk server.

The Risk ruleset operates in a fashion not dissimilar to the physical Risk board game, with only a few changes to the game mechanics. Instead of players making moves individually all moves are now initiated simultaneously by all players. 
*Bring attention to board
We see here the traditional risk board is translated to a starmap.
*Motion to wormholes
These wormholes indicate the connectivity between planets. When we get around to issuing orders connected planets will be filled in for you to choose from. Unlike other rulesets Risk has no ships, therefore armies reside on the surface of planets and when moved are moved instantly accross one turn.

*Bring attention owned planet
Here we have a planet we own. When selecting a planet we can either select the planet from the planet list here
*Bring attention to planet list, select planet
Just like the board game risk planets can have any number of armies that represents the strength of that territory. This number of units can be ascertained in the info pane
*Bring attention to info pane, hold mouse over Armies number.
We see here that PLANETNAME has ARMIESNUMBER units. You might also notice a quantity Minable here
*Bring attention to Number minable
This number represents the number of armies availible for reinforcements, something you may be familiar with if you have played risk. 

Now that you are familiar with planets and armies we are ready to move on to issuing orders. 
Risk has three basic order types, Reinforce, Move, and Colonize. The most basic order, Reinforce
*Show reinforce order on an owned planet.

lets a player reinforce a planet with Armies they have received from either their beginning total or any added units received each turn. Just like the Risk board game players receive reinforcements each turn based on the number of planets/territories they own; The exact number is determined by the server options. To find out how many Armies you have on a planet, and how many are availible, we look to the information panel for an owned planet (or even an enemies planet).
*Show information panel

In the information pane we see the number of current armies HERE
*bring attention to Current Armies

And the number of availible Armies HERE
*Bring attention to the minable armies.

While the current armies are specific to each planet, the minable armies is a total across all planets. Be careful when issuing reinforcement orders as you can use up all your armies before all your orders are processed.
*Clear out of reinforcement order issueing

The next order type, Move,
*Show move order on owned planet


Lets a player move or attack other planets adjacent to the issuing planet. 
*Show populated adjacency list.
While tpclient does not yet allow for lines to be drawn to indicate connectivity the move order target drop down will always be populated with adjacent planets.

*Hover over adjacent planet
Hovering over a planet or system can quickly tell us the name of that system, and we can check in our move order to see if we can move there. Once we pick a planet to move to, friendly or otherwise, we select a number of units to move to that system.
*Select a planet
The number of units availible to be moved can be no more than 1 less than the total number of units on a planet. Since it is possible to reinforce a planet before attempting to move units the move order will always make sure you don't exceed this limit. Long story short, don't worry about how many units your trying to move, you will never leave a planet with less than 1 unit.
*Enter a super high bid, end turn
Should you attempt to move units onto an enemy system an attack movement will be initiated. When attacking another system a number of dice will be rolled for each "side" (attacker or defender) and depending on the outcome of that roll either side may or may not lose units. If you should vanquish all the enemies units you will gain control of the system you attacked. This attack move will be the mainstay of your orders.

The final order type is the Colonize order. 
*Hover over colonize order, then create one.
This is a special order type that is not always enabled on a server, depending on the game type, and disappears from use when all systems are occupied. The colonize order allows what could be called a "long distance move order with bidding". Colonize orders can be issued to colonize ANY open planet in the universe
*Show populated list
However, unlike Move orders, where the very first order to move to a planet instantly succeeds, Colonize orders tally all Colonize orders on a planet as Bids. These bids are then ordered, and the highest valid bid is completed. The client will always allow you to bid more than you have, but your actual bid will only be counted as how many units you can move from any one territory. At this moment bidding across multiple planets is not allowed.
*Enter a bid, end turn.

Once all players have selected "End of Turn" or the time limit of the turn is exceeded (depending on your server) all issued orders will be completed.
*End a turn
We didn't issue any orders this turn, but had we, they would be processed in a certain order. Order queues in Risk and TP in general operate on a First In - First out. The risk ruleset, specifically, first completes all colonize orders it sees, then all Reinforce orders it sees, then the all the Move orders it sees 

*Thank user for watching, suggest there are many nuances to playing risk on thousand parsec that can be learned by watching the advanced play screencast.

**All of this should be very low-key and, frankly, basic. The user should be able to issue all 3 order types after watching the screencast, but not understand any of the nuances in mechanics or otherwise.
