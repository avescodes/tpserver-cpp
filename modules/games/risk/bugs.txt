Current known bugs
- Placing 3 1 unit bids from a planet with only 3 units crashes server (loaded quickstart-risk-bid config).
I believe this bug is caused because the code doesn't properly handle a bid existing but none of the bids being valid.
- Unable to delete last "1 of 1" message on mac client during quickstart-risk-random game.
- Input box for number of units on move order has disappeared on Mac client.
- Mac client; (maybe all) it is difficult to select individual planets as wormholes continually get autoselected.

To be fixed/changed:
- Moving reinforcement counts to a placeholder planet for each individual player. This will cut down on download times.
-
