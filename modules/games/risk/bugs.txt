-Bus error, attempting to colonize 2 places? couldn't reproduce
-You have no objects error when player DOES have objects. x2 (can still issue orders)
	Joined game mid-game after 1 player had already won
	Persisted after colonizing more planets
	Player is defeated, winner gets winning message, quits client.
	Defender does "get universe", server fails on bus error during "Get Message Frame"".
	
To Test:
colonization:
	over bids - appears to work
	multiple over bids - appears to work
	multiple bids - appears to work
Move:
	conflict orders - works, but logically the behaviour can be strange.
	
Noticed:
-"Chaining" of moves is possible to move a large number of units across the map.
