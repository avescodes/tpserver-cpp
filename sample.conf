##Sample tpserver-cpp config file
## This file outlines the configuration options and syntax that can be used to
## configure tpserver-cpp

##About this file.
## If you use this file directly as a config file for tpserver-cpp, the defaults will
## be used.
## If you uncomment out the lines beginning with a single "#" character, you
## will still get the defaults.
## Lines starting with two "#" characters is the documention for this file.

##Directories and defaults
## By default the settings are taken from
##    /etc/tpserver-cpp/tpserver.conf
## but this can be overridden by adding these command line args
##    -C /dir/to/settingsfile.conf
## or
##    --configure /dir/to/settingsfile.conf
## or
##    --config_file /dir/to/settingsfile.conf
## All settings can set on the console once the server is running.

##SYNTAX
## Comments start with a "#" and go to the end of the line.
## The configuration lines have the format "<key> = <value>"
## Keys have a restricted set of characters.
## Values can be inclosed in single (') or double (") quotes, or not enclosed
## at all if the value has no spaces or quotes.
## The keys and possible (and default) values are outlined below.
## The last instance of the key in the file is used.


##Game settings

## game_name - the published name of the game.
## This is used when publishing the information about the game to identify the
## game. It does not need to be the dns name for the host.
## Defaults to Tpserver-cpp.
## Example: game_name = "My Thousand Parsec Game"
#game_name = Tpserver-cpp

## game_shortname - the short name of the game.
## This is used when publishing the information about the game to identify the
## game. It should be a few characters, lower case and now spaces.
## Defaults to "tp".
## Example: game_shortname = "mtpg"
#game_shortname = tp

## admin_email - the email address of the admin. This is optional and is published
## through to the metaserver and zeroconf.
## Example: admin_email = "lee@thousandparsec.net"
#admin_email =

## game_comment - a comment about the game. This is optional and is published
## through the metaserver.
## Example: game_comment = "This is a comment about this game."
#game_comment =

## ruleset - sets which ruleset to load.
## Setting this to the ruleset wanted will automatically load the ruleset named.
## If it is not set, no ruleset is loaded.
## Example: ruleset = minisec
#ruleset =

## persistence - set which persistence method to use.
## Automatically loads the named persistence method. If it is not set, the default
## in memory only persistence method is set.
## Example: persistence = tpmysql
#persistence =

## tpscheme - sets which TpScheme implementation to use.
## If set, loads the named TpScheme implementation. If not set or set to "auto"
## then an available implementation will be loaded.
## Example: tpscheme = tpmzscheme
## Example: tpscheme = tpguile
#tpscheme = auto

## game_load - automatically load the game.
## If set to "yes" then the game is automatically loaded ready to be started.
## In practice, at least ruleset above must be set.
#game_load = no

## game_start - automatically start the game.
## If set to "yes" then the game is automatically started and the end of turn
## timer set.
## In practice, game_load must be "yes" and succeed. You will want to set this
## configuration option once the server is running a game so that manual interaction
## is not required to get it running again after stopping the server. You will want to
## set network_start below to "yes" as well.
#game_start = no

## network_start - automatically start the network subsystem.
## If set to "yes" then the network subsystem is started and the listening sockets set.
## In practice, game_start must be "yes" and succeed. You will want to set this
## configuration option once the server is running a game so that manual interaction
## is not required to get it running again after stopping the server.
#network_start = no

## add_players - allows new players to join the game
## If set to "yes" then players that register using Account frames will join the
## game. When not set to "yes" no new players will join the game. The default
## is no, to prevent players joining until the game is ready.
#add_players = no

## autoadd_players - chooses weather new players are automatically created
##                               at login.
## If this setting is set to "yes" and add_players setting is set to "yes",
## if a player trys to login with a player name that
## is not currently know, a new player is created and added to the game. This
## is a method of self registersation. If playing a closed game, or the players
## are all set up, set to "no"
#autoadd_players = no

## game_media_base - the base url for media for the game.
## Sent to the clients to tell them where the base of the media tree is,
## which is also where the media.gz file is.
## Default is http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/repos/media/client/
## Example: game_media_base = "http://llnz.dyndns.org/tp/media/"
#game_media_base = "http://darcs.thousandparsec.net/repos/media/client/"


##End of Turn Timer settings
## Some games may override these, some may provide different defaults

## turn_player_threshold - the threshold for changing from the under_threshold
## turn length to the over_threshold turn length. Set as a percentage of "alive" players
## that have sent frames saying they are finished for the turn.
## Becareful when setting this to 100 (ie 100%) and if the under_threshold
## is 0 (ie, no time limit) then the turn might never happen because a player doesn't send
## the TurnFinished frame.
## Default is 0, ie, always use over_threshold.
## Example: turn_player_threshold = 50 #50% of players finish before using over_threshold
#turn_player_threshold = 0

## turn_length_under_threshold - sets the length of the turn in seconds, unless the
## threshold is reached first.
## If set to 0, the end of turn timer will wait "forever" until the threshold is met.
## Default is 0 (wait until threshold)
## Example: turn_length_under_threshold = 86400 # 24 hours maximum time between turns
#turn_length_under_threshold = 0

## turn_length_over_threshold - sets the length of the turn in seconds, after the
## threshold has been reached.
## If set to 0, the end of turn will start immediately after the threshold is reached, unless
## the threshold is zero (and the length is defaulted up to 60 seconds).
## Default is 0 (do end of turn immediately, or 60 seconds if threshold is 0)
## Example: turn_length_over_threshold = 600 # 10 minutes for the rest of the player to finish
#turn_length_over_threshold = 0


##Logging settings

## log_level - sets the level of logging done.
## This can be used to control the amount of output on the console.
## The value is an integer, coresponding to the lowest level that is logged:
## 0 - Debug output (default)
## 1 - Informational output (connects, disconnects, notices, etc)

#log_level = 0

## log_colour - set weather to use colour for logging output to the terminal
## If logging to a terminal (command line/console), it maybe possible to use
## colour to make info, warning and error messages stand out. Most linux
## consoles support colour.  Colours used are:
## Red for errors
## Yellow for warnings
## Green for Info
## Standard console colour for debug.
## Only the message type is coloured (ie the "< Info  >" bit), the message
## itself is always in the standard console colour.
## To turn on colour, set to "yes"
#log_colour = no

## log_console - If you want to log to the console, this needs to be
## defined to "yes"
## Example: log_console = yes

## Example: log_syslog = yes
#log_syslog = no

## config_file - sets the config file to read.
## Sets the configuration file to read. Not exactly useful for inside the config
## file, but can be set from the command line.
