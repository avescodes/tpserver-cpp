##Sample tpserver-cpp config file
## This file outlines the configuration options and syntax that can be used to
## configure tpserver-cpp

##About this file.
## If you use this file directly as a config file for tpserver-cpp, the defaults will
## be used.
## If you uncomment out the lines beginning with a single "#" character, you
## will still get the defaults.
## Lines starting with two "#" characters is the documention for this file.

##SYNTAX
## Comments start with a "#" and go to the end of the line.
## The configuration lines have the format "<key> = <value>"
## Keys have a restricted set of characters.
## Values can be inclosed in single (') or double (") quotes, or not enclosed
## at all if the value has no spaces or quotes.
## The keys and possible (and default) values are outlined below.
## The last instance of the key in the file is used.


##Server wide settings

## log_level - sets the level of logging done.
## This can be used to control the amount of output on the console.
## The value is an integer, coresponding to the lowest level that is logged:
## 0 - Debug output (default)
## 1 - Informational output (connects, disconnects, notices, etc)
## 2 - Warning output (Some types of failures, non-fatal, but possibly unfair)
## 3 - Error output (Errors, mostly fatal)
#log_level = 0

## log_colour - set weather to use colour for logging output to the terminal
## If logging to a terminal (command line/console), it maybe possible to use
## colour to make info, warning and error messages stand out. Most linux
## consoles support colour.  Colours used are:
## Red for errors
## Yellow for warnings
## Green for Info
## Standard console colour for debug.
## Only the message type is coloured (ie the "< Info  >" bit), the message
## itself is always in the standard console colour.
## To turn on colour, set to "yes"
#log_colour = no

##Game settings

## autoadd_players - chooses weather new players are automatically created
##                               at login.
## If this setting is set to "yes", if a player trys to login with a player name that
## is not currently know, a new player is created and added to the game. This
## is a method of self registersation. If playing a closed game, or the players
## are all set up, set to "no"
#autoadd_players = no

##Persisence settings

## Mysql settings - Only if Mysql is configured

## mysql_db - selects the database in mysql to use.
## No default, must be set to use Mysql database for persistence.
## The database name is expected.
## For example mysql_db = tpserver
#mysql_db =

## mysql_host - selects the Mysql host to use.
## Sets the host the mysql database is running on.  Empty is considered
## to be localhost.
#mysql_host =

## mysql_user - selects the Mysql user to use.
## Set the username to use when connecting to the mysql server. The
## default is to use the username the tpserver-cpp is running as.
#mysql_user =

## mysql_pass - the password for the user for Mysql.
## Defaults to empty. Almost cerntainly needs to be set to the real password.
#mysql_pass =

## mysql_socket - the mysql unix socket to be used.
## Defaults to mysql default. Only needs to be set if you have an unusual
## setup.
#mysql_socket =

## mysql_port - the mysql port to use.
## Defaults 0, which is mapped to the mysql default. Only needs to be set if
## you have an unusual setup.
#mysql_port = 0

##Network settings

## tp_addr - the address to listen on for the tp (tcp, no tls) socket to listen on.
## Defaults to empty, empty is all addresses available. Set if you only want the
## tp socket to listen on a particular address.
#tp_addr =

## tp_port - sets the port the tp (tcp, no tls) socket listens on.
## Defaults to 0, which makes it listen on the default port (6923).
#tp_port = 0

## x509_tls - set if x509 certificate is to be used with TLS ports (tps and https).
## Set to "yes" if you have an x509 certificate you want to use. If you set this
## to yes, you should set x509_trust_file, x509_cert_file and x509_key_file.
#x509_tls = no

## x509_trust_file - set the trust file (CA-certificate) to use.
## No default.
#x509_trust_file =

## x509_cert_file - set the cert file (our certificate) to use.
## No default.
#x509_cert_file =

## x509_key_file - set the key file (our private key for our cert) to use.
## No default.
#x509_key_file =

## tps - selects weather tps socket is started when network is started.
## Only effective when TLS (gnutls) is configured. Defaults to no. Set
## to "yes" to have tps socket start.
#tps = no

## tps_addr - the address to listen on for the tps (tcp, tls) socket to listen on.
## Defaults to empty, empty is all addresses available. Set if you only want the
## tps socket to listen on a particular address.
#tps_addr =

## tps_port - sets the port the tp (tcp, tls) socket listens on.
## Defaults to 0, which makes it listen on the default port (6924).
#tps_port = 0

## https - selects weather https tunneling socket is started when network is
##             started.
## Only effective when TLS (gnutls) is configured. Defaults to no. Set
## to "yes" to have https socket start.
#https = no

## https_addr - the address to listen on for the https (https tunneling) socket
##                      to listen on.
## Defaults to empty, empty is all addresses available. Set if you only want the
## https socket to listen on a particular address.
#https_addr =

## https_port - sets the port the http (https tunneling) socket listens on.
## Defaults to 0, which makes it listen on the default port (443).
#https_port = 0
