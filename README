REQUIRES (to build also requires the dev packages)
========
readline (standard with most distributions)
pthreads (part of libc, standard)
libgnutls (common in latest distros, optional needed for secure sockets)

mzscheme (www.plt-scheme.org) [LGPL]
 - note: you will probably need to pass the directory to the plt
   to configure, and it will generally be /usr/lib/plt (as in 
   debian), therefore, your configure command will be:
     ./configure --with-mzscheme=/usr/lib/plt
   You may also need to add the lib subdirectory to /etc/ld.so.conf
   and run ldconfig as root before tpserver-cpp will run.

mysql (www.mysql.com) [GPL]
 - note: see ./configure --help for options and env vars.
