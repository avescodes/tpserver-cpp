REQUIRES
========
mzscheme (www.plt-scheme.org) [LGPL]
 - note: you will probably need to pass the directory to the plt
   to configure, and it will generally be /usr/lib/plt (as in 
   debian), therefore, your configure command will be:
     ./configure --with-mzscheme=/usr/lib/plt
   You may also need to add the lib subdirectory to /etc/ld.so.conf
   and run ldconfig as root before tpserver-cpp will run.
