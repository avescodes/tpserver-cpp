This is the server for Thousand Parsec.

Requires a Unix-like environment, because it uses dynamic loading.
Tested under Linux.

REQUIRES (to build also requires the dev packages/headers)
========
pthreads (part of libc, standard)
libtprl (replaces/uses readline) (www.thousandparsec.net/tp/) [GPL]

OPTIONAL
========
libgnutls12 (common in latest distros, optional needed for secure sockets) [GPL]
Version 1.2.0 or higher.

mysql (www.mysql.com) [GPL]
MySQL is optional, but is needed for the mysql persistence backend. The client
side library is required.
 - note: see ./configure --help for options and env vars.


OPTIONS (need one or the other)
=======
The configuration will try to locate these packages and will give an error if
neither is found. Both can be present and will be built.

mzscheme (www.plt-scheme.org) [LGPL]
 - note: you will probably need to pass the directory to the plt
   to configure, and it will generally be /usr/lib/plt (as in 
   debian), therefore, your configure command will be:
     ./configure --with-mzscheme=/usr/lib/plt
   You may also need to add the lib subdirectory to /etc/ld.so.conf
   and run ldconfig as root before tpserver-cpp will run.

Guile (www.gnu.org/software/guile/) [GPL]
Should be on most systems already.
